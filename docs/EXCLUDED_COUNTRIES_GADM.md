# GADM Data Import - Excluded Countries Documentation

## Overview

This document lists countries that were **excluded** from the GADM (Global Administrative Areas) data import due to geometry size limitations in Firestore. These countries have administrative boundaries that, when dissolved into proper administrative units, exceed Firestore's 1MB document size limit.

## Import Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL (Excluding Large Countries)

**Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Import Strategy:** Exclude Large Countries (`--exclude-large`)  
**Total Documents Imported:** 282,046 documents  
**Countries Covered:** ~170 countries (excluding the 22 listed below)

## Excluded Countries (22 Total)

The following countries were excluded from the GADM import because their dissolved administrative geometries are too large for Firestore:

### üåç **Large Continental Countries**
1. **Russia** / **Russian Federation** - Largest country by area
2. **Canada** - Second largest country by area  
3. **United States** / **United States of America** - Large with complex state boundaries
4. **China** - Large with many administrative divisions
5. **Brazil** - Largest South American country
6. **Australia** - Large island continent
7. **India** - Large with complex state boundaries
8. **Kazakhstan** - Largest landlocked country

### üèúÔ∏è **Large Desert/Saharan Countries**
9. **Algeria** - Largest African country
10. **Sudan** - Large northeastern African country
11. **Libya** - Large North African country
12. **Chad** - Large central African country
13. **Niger** - Large West African country
14. **Angola** - Large southwestern African country

### üå¥ **Other Large Countries**
15. **Democratic Republic of the Congo** - Large central African country
16. **Saudi Arabia** - Large Middle Eastern country
17. **Mexico** - Large North American country
18. **Indonesia** - Large archipelagic country
19. **Iran** - Large Middle Eastern country
20. **Mongolia** - Large landlocked Asian country
21. **Peru** - Large South American country

## Impact Analysis

### ‚úÖ **What's Working**
- **170+ countries** have full GADM administrative coverage
- **282,046 documents** successfully imported with proper geometry dissolution
- **Point-in-polygon queries** working correctly for included countries
- **All 5 administrative levels** (State/Province ‚Üí Neighborhood) available for covered countries

### ‚ùå **What's Missing**
- **22 major countries** have **no GADM administrative data**
- Users in excluded countries will only get **Natural Earth** data (Country/Map Unit level)
- **No sub-national administrative boundaries** for excluded countries

## Verification Results

### ‚úÖ **Successful Test Locations**
- **Paris, France**: 5/5 levels ‚úÖ
- **Munich, Germany**: 4/5 levels ‚úÖ  
- **Kigali, Rwanda**: 4/5 levels ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå **Missing Coverage Examples**
- **New York, USA**: No GADM data (only Natural Earth)
- **Sydney, Australia**: No GADM data (only Natural Earth)
- **Moscow, Russia**: No GADM data (only Natural Earth)
- **Toronto, Canada**: No GADM data (only Natural Earth)

## Future Work Recommendations

### üîß **Option 1: Enhanced Geometry Simplification**
- Implement more aggressive progressive simplification
- Use dynamic tolerance based on geometry complexity
- Consider bounding box fallbacks for extremely large areas

### üóÇÔ∏è **Option 2: Geometry Chunking**
- Split large administrative areas into smaller sub-documents
- Implement cross-document geometry queries
- Maintain hierarchical relationships across chunks

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Option 3: External Storage**
- Store large geometries in Cloud Storage
- Keep metadata and bounding boxes in Firestore
- Implement hybrid query system

### üéØ **Option 4: Selective Import**
- Import only Level 1-2 for large countries
- Focus on populated areas with smaller geometries
- Prioritize urban administrative boundaries

## Technical Details

### Exclusion Implementation
```python
# In scripts/replace_gadm_data.py
self.problematic_countries = [
    'Russia', 'Russian Federation',
    'Canada', 'United States', 'United States of America',
    # ... (full list above)
]

# Exclusion logic
if self.exclude_large and not test_countries:
    level_data = level_data[~level_data['COUNTRY'].isin(self.problematic_countries)]
```

### Size Limits
- **Firestore Document Limit**: 1MB (1,048,576 bytes)
- **Safety Limit Used**: 900KB (900,000 bytes)
- **Progressive Simplification**: 0.01 ‚Üí 0.02 ‚Üí 0.05 ‚Üí 0.1 ‚Üí 0.2 ‚Üí 0.5 ‚Üí 1.0 ‚Üí 2.0 ‚Üí 5.0

## Current Workarounds

### For Applications
1. **Check country coverage** before attempting GADM queries
2. **Fallback to Natural Earth** data for excluded countries
3. **Use bounding box queries** for approximate location matching

### For Users
- **Covered countries**: Full administrative hierarchy available
- **Excluded countries**: Only country/territory level boundaries available
- **Mixed queries**: Some locations may have partial coverage
